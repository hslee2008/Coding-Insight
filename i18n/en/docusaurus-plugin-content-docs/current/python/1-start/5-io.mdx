# Input & Output

Input is when you enter information to a program, function to get an output.

The output here is the result of the program.

## Printing

Printing is the process of writing something to the screen.

If you want to print the text "Hello World" you could use something like the following.

```py
print('Hello, World!')
print('5')
print('!@#$')
```

The text inside the quotes is what is printed.

## Input

Input is when you let the users enter information into a program.

It is either saved or used directly in the program.

```py
print(input('>>>'))
```

The user can now type in after '>>>' in the program.

Here, we are getting the information from the user and printing it.
